# Portfolio (Recreated With Bootstrap)

## Description

This project is a recreation of my previously made webpage, this time utilising Bootstrap components and grid system. I found this not only to be a massive timesaver, but a framework that helped build my confidence with layout systems, helping me understand Flexbox a little better and introducing me to Bootstrap grid, a third option for layouts going forward.

I chose to keep the same layout as the previous portfolio, as I had spent a lot of time visually designing the layout. With the time I saved, I plan to work on some projects to populate the portfolio with.

## Installation

No installation necessary. Please visit https://alex-quayle.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/ to view the webpage. Below is a screenshot of the deployed page:

### Learning Resources Utilised

In addition to the following links, the class sessions held by the edX front-end bootcamp team have been invaluable for this challenge in my understanding of how to install, use and customise Bootstrap 5. Additionally, I re-used previous styling values, images and text copy from the previous challenge.
